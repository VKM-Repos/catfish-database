If the problem persists, try refreshing the page or contact your system administrator.",
  },
  {

  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when I split a pond or batch?',
    answer:
      "When you split a pond or batch, the system creates new records while maintaining the historical data of the original. You'll need to specify the split ratio, new pond assignments, and estimated fish counts. All previous reports remain linked to the original batch for tracking purposes. The new batches will have separate reporting streams going forward.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I view my report history?',
    answer:
      'Access "Report History" from the main dashboard. You can filter by report type, date range, pond, or batch. Use the search function to find specific reports quickly.

  },
  {
    question: 'Who can I contact for technical support?',
